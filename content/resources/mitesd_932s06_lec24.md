    \ Taft Broome\nView the complete course: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/esd-932-engineering-ethics-spring-2006/\n\

    \nThis course introduces the theory and the practice of engineering ethics using\
    \ a multi-disciplinary and cross-cultural approach. Theory includes ethics and\
    \ philosophy of engineering. Historical cases are taken primarily from the scholarly\
    \ literatures on engineering ethics, and hypothetical cases are written by students.\
    \ Each student will write a story by selecting an ancestor or mythic hero as a\
    \ substitute for a character in a historical case. Students will compare these\
    \ cases and recommend action.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\nMore information\
